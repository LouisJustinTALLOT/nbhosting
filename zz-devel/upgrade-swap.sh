# we have 2 boxes thurst and thermals that play the roles
# of nbhosting and nbhosting-dev on the inria.fr domain
#
# in general we have
# thurst on nbhosting        - it's the big one - and
# thermals on nbhosting-dev  - a more modest setup, although quite decent
# 
# the purpose of this script is to automate swapping these roles 
# 
# we need this initially so that we can upgrade thurst from f25 to f27

# several things need to be taken care of
#
##### (*) IP
# the following DNS names are defined
#
# nbhosting.inria.fr     138.96.19.1
# thurst.inria.fr        138.96.19.2
# thermals.inria.fr      138.96.19.4
# nbhosting-dev.inria.fr 138.96.19.14
#
# we don't use DNS to swap because it is so slow to propagate
# instead, each box has systemd services defined to take or release
# the 2 addresses
