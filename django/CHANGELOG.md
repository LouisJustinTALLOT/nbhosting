# 0.10.1 2019 Mar 12

* refactored a new source code layout, resulting in much cleaner imports,
  and the ability to invoke django-defined management commands from `/usr/bin/nbh-manage`

# Jan 2018

We've admittedly been rather sloppy wrt versioning here. The thing is the code
gets deployed on both `nbhosting.inria.fr` and its sistership
`nbhosting-dev.inria.fr` directly from the public repo on github.

# 0.1.0 - 2017 Apr 27

* first versioned release
