        <p id='text'>Some common causes for thisÂ :
            <ul>
                <li>
                from a MOOC system like edx or moodle,
                this probably means the course is ill-configured, 
                get in touch with your teacher</li>
                <li>
                in classroom mode, your git repo may be out of date from upstream;
                use the jupyter lab app, and its git plugin,
                to pull from upstream before retrying.

                If the git plugin is not available in this course image,
                you can always use git from the command line, 
                after you create a terminal in jupyterlab;
                be aware that your git repo for a course
                is in the <code>work</code> directory.
