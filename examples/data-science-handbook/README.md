an example of I did set up a course from jakevdp's handbook at 
https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook

I could use 2 options to install these:
* I could have forked the original repo, and add these files in a nbhosting/ subdir at the toplevel
* or, less intrusively, I could just add these files in /nbhosting/local/data-science-handbook
  assuming that this is the coursename that I picked for that course
